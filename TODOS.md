# Audr TODOS

Captured during /plan-eng-review on 2026-04-27. Items are deferred from v1 with explicit rationale, not silently dropped.

---

## TODO 1 — SARIF chunking for large monorepo scans

**What:** When a scan emits more findings than fit in GitHub Code Scanning's SARIF size cap (~10MB compressed, ~25k results), chunk the output into multiple SARIF files OR cap findings emitted with a clear "additional N findings hidden" notice.

**Why:** v1 single-machine scans rarely hit the cap. v2 SaaS fleet aggregation (Phase 3) will routinely produce SARIF that exceeds the cap as it aggregates findings across hundreds of dev machines. If not designed in advance, it becomes a hot fix during the first big customer rollout.

**Pros:**
- Designed in advance, ships cleanly with the SaaS aggregation layer
- Avoids "first big customer rollout" surprise
- Forces a conscious decision on chunking strategy (multiple SARIF files vs result truncation vs both)

**Cons:**
- Premature for v1 (single-machine scans won't approach the limit)
- Requires actually testing against real GitHub limits — those have moved before

**Context:** GitHub Code Scanning SARIF docs: https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/integrating-with-code-scanning/sarif-support-for-code-scanning. Limits as of 2026: 10MB compressed, 25k results, 1k tags per result. Chunking patterns from existing tools: Snyk and Semgrep both partition by repository when uploading from a multi-repo scan; CodeQL emits one SARIF per database.

**Depends on / blocked by:** Phase 3 SaaS fleet-aggregation work. Not actionable until SaaS layer starts.

---

## TODO 3 — Telemetry beacon design (`--share-anon` flag wiring)

**What:** v1 ships with the `--share-anon` flag wired in CLI surface but no-op (logs the intent locally, sends nothing). Phase 3 (SaaS) defines the actual schema, endpoint, opt-in copy, and privacy review. The flag exists in v1 so users can opt-in early; their preference is captured in local config and honored once the endpoint is live.

**Why:** Designing the telemetry endpoint, schema, opt-in flow, and privacy review before there's a SaaS layer to receive it is premature infrastructure. But removing the `--share-anon` flag entirely and re-adding it later means users who opt-in now don't carry their preference forward. The middle path: ship the flag, persist the preference, no-op until Phase 3.

**Pros:**
- Avoids premature infra in v1
- Captures opt-in preference from day-one users
- Phase 3 telemetry has a real audience (existing users with `--share-anon` set) instead of starting from zero
- Decouples "user wants to share" from "endpoint exists to receive"

**Cons:**
- Slight risk of users thinking telemetry is active when it's no-op (mitigate via clear `--help` text: "Opt-in for v2 telemetry; v1 sends nothing")
- Adds one config field that does nothing in v1

**Context:** Audr is a security tool. Telemetry needs an *unusually* careful privacy review — the events it would emit (which MCP servers, which configs, which rules fire) themselves leak information about the customer's environment. Phase 3 design must default to aggregate-only metrics (rule-fire counts) and explicitly avoid any payload that could identify a specific customer's MCP server, secret pattern, or internal repo.

**Depends on / blocked by:** Phase 3 SaaS layer. Privacy review must happen before any byte is sent.

---

## TODO 4 — BYOD privacy mode (`--byod` flag)

**What:** First-class product axis from the v1 design (P3): two policy modes (BYOD vs Company-Owned) with two output shapes. BYOD: developer sees full findings; company sees aggregate only. Company-Owned: company gets full per-machine telemetry. Deferred from v1.2 because we want 3+ design partners onboarded with the simpler model before locking in the BYOD primitives.

**Why:** Differentiation versus Snyk/Wiz: no incumbent ships BYOD-aware posture management. The two-mode product is a real moat per the v1 office-hours analysis. But designing the privacy split without a real CISO partner sized for BYOD use is premature — we'd build the wrong primitives.

**Pros:** Real moat versus broad-posture tools; named publicly on the roadmap creates outbound conversation hook; pairs cleanly with the v1.2 policy file (BYOD mode = different default policy + different output filter).

**Cons:** Demo needs two scenarios (extra week of demo prep); requires committing to specific privacy primitives that may not match what design partners actually want.

**Context:** P3 in the v1 design doc (`2026-04-27-audr.md`). Implementation hooks: a `mode: byod | company-owned` field in policy.yaml, output formatter that filters per-machine details when mode=byod, daemon flag `--byod` that overrides config.

**Depends on / blocked by:** Three v1.2 design partners onboarded with feedback. Target: v1.3.

---

## TODO 5 — Windows Authenticode signing (closed — won't do)

**Decision (2026-05-16):** explicitly closed. audr is open-source; the $300–500/yr EV-cert recurring spend isn't worth removing a first-run SmartScreen warning that a SHA-256-verifying installer already mitigates. Users can verify the cosign-signed `SHA256SUMS` before "Run anyway" — that's the trust anchor.

Original rationale (kept as historical context):

> Sign Windows release binaries with Authenticode using an EV cert.
> Every first-time Windows install in v1.1 hits SmartScreen.
> ...
> Cons: $300–500/year recurring; hardware token shipped physically; EV cert vendor diligence.

Re-open this TODO if a paying customer demands Authenticode and underwrites the cert cost.

---

## TODO 6 — GitHub Action template (`audr-action`)

**What:** Published GitHub Action (`harshmaur/audr-action@v1`) that runs `audr scan` in CI on PR + push, uploads SARIF to GitHub Code Scanning, comments on PRs with new findings. Listed on the GitHub Marketplace.

**Why:** Today's CI integration is "add `audr scan` as a step in your own workflow." That works but it's not what platform engineers expect from a security scanner. A first-party Action with SARIF upload, PR comments, and Marketplace listing turns audr from "binary you run" into "integration you install."

**Pros:** Marketplace listing = passive discovery channel; PR-comment flow is the established UX (Snyk, Semgrep do this); aligns with SARIF-into-Code-Scanning thesis from v1 P2 refinement.

**Cons:** Adds a separate repo to maintain (`harshmaur/audr-action`); needs its own release pipeline; PR-comment surface is a feature creep magnet.

**Context:** Phase 2 OSS CLI extensions in the v1 design doc. Not v1.1 (platform completeness) or v1.2 (policy lake). Natural fit for v1.3 after policy editing has been validated.

**Depends on / blocked by:** v1.2 policy file shape stable (Action template should embed default policy for new users). Target: v1.3.

---

## TODO 7 — Custom rule definitions (Semgrep-style YAML rules)

**What:** v1.2 ships layered-overrides only (built-ins in Go, user overrides in YAML). v1.3 adds custom rule definitions: users write their own detection rules in YAML with a declarative match spec (path glob + regex/AST match + severity).

**Why:** CISOs ask "can we write our own rules?" in every demo. v1.2's answer is "you can override built-ins but not add new ones." v1.3 closes the gap.

**Pros:** Headline-feature parity with Semgrep/Trivy/Gitleaks; unlocks customer-specific rules ("flag any MCP server we haven't allowlisted"); each customer rule is a sales conversation.

**Cons:** Match engine surface is large (regex vs glob vs structural vs AST); user-written rules are a footgun (bad regex, slow matchers, missed escape); requires a rule-test framework so users can verify their rules fire correctly.

**Context:** Issue 4 of /plan-eng-review 2026-05-15. User chose layered overrides for v1.2; this is the deferred Option B (Semgrep-style declarative rules). Architecturally, the v1.2 layered model is forward-compatible: custom rules become additional entries in the same policy.yaml under a new `custom-rules:` key.

**Depends on / blocked by:** v1.2 ships and design partners use it for ≥1 month. Target: v1.3.

---

## TODO 8 — v1.4 Approach B: AV-feel daily-driver dashboard

**What:** Default-green `/dashboard` route, "Protected for N days" streak primitive, health score 0-100 driven by open chains + criticals, single-banner threat card when a chain fires. The dashboard's default state is comfort (green checkmark, last-verified timestamp). One bold banner only when a chain actually fires.

**Why:** v1.3 ships dedup + roll-up + override snippets (Approach A from the loveable-audr design doc). That earns the founder's attention back. Approach B is what turns "I opened it today" into "I open this every morning." The streak primitive + health score is the first emotional hook audr has had.

**Pros:** Real differentiation vs Snyk/Wiz/SonarQube (none of them feel like AV — they all feel like Jenkins). Forensic mode survives intact at `/audit` for future CISO conversations.

**Cons:** More UX surface area to dogfood. If the "feel" is off by 10% it lands worse than v1.3 alone. A health score is a number people argue with.

**Context:** Approach B in `parallels-main-design-loveable-audr-20260515-171437.md`. Reuses the v1.2 htmx+Alpine stack and the v1.1 toaster. New: `internal/health/`, `internal/streak/`, dashboard templates for the AV view.

**Depends on / blocked by:** v1.3 ships AND ≥2 weeks of dogfood data confirm the dedup pass earns daily attention (the founder voluntarily opens the dashboard 5 days in a row). Target: v1.4.

---

## TODO 9 — v1.5 Approach C: Active quarantine + undo

**What:** When a critical attack chain fires, daemon (opt-in, first-run consent) quarantines the offending config file into `~/.audr/quarantined/<chain-id>/<timestamp>/`. JSONL audit log of every quarantine event. One-click undo from the dashboard. Toast: "audr blocked an exfil chain. View / Undo."

**Why:** The "audr blocked N attacks this week" line is the genuine category-defining wedge — the line no developer-security tool currently ships. Earns the antivirus framing on substance, not just on UI. Closes the loop audr keeps almost-closing: detect → block → undo → green.

**Pros:** Genuinely novel. Earns inbound CISO conversations without a single demo. Active blocking is the unowned wedge from the v1 office-hours, finally made concrete.

**Cons:** Trust bar is much higher than v1.3 — audr is now editing config files, not just reading them. One bad quarantine that breaks a user's IDE = catastrophic trust loss. Defender has 30 years of brand; audr has 6 weeks since v1.0. Some chains (e.g. `claude-third-party-plugin-enabled`) have no single file to quarantine.

**Context:** Approach C in `parallels-main-design-loveable-audr-20260515-171437.md`. Deserves its own office-hours session before scoping — the trust model + first-run consent UX + per-rule consent semantics are all design-partner-shaped decisions.

**Depends on / blocked by:** v1.4 Approach B validated. Own office-hours + plan-eng-review session before any code. Target: v1.5.

## TODO 10 — policy.yaml: user-extensible path-class table

**What:** Allow users to extend `internal/triage/authority.go`'s hardcoded path-class table via `~/.audr/policy.yaml`. Map custom path globs to authority labels (YOU / MAINTAINER / UPSTREAM).

**Why:** v1.3 hardcodes ~20 path-class entries based on common dev-machine layouts (Claude Code plugin cache paths, Cursor extension paths, common project roots). Power users with non-standard setups (corporate monorepos, custom vendor cache paths, sandboxed environments) will want to extend this. CISOs onboarded under the v1.4 BYOD work (TODO 4) will almost certainly need it.

**Pros:** Forward-compatible with the v1.2 policy lake. Closes a real gap for the v2 enterprise audience. Modest implementation cost once v1.3 ships.

**Cons:** Premature without enterprise design partners — risk of locking in a YAML schema that doesn't match what design partners need. Three-axis policy (rule overrides + suppressions + path-classes) starts to feel enterprise-shaped if shipped before there's an enterprise asking for it.

**Context:** Surfaced during /plan-eng-review 2026-05-15 (Code Quality section, path-class table decision). v1.3 ships hardcoded for speed; this TODO captures the natural next axis.

**Depends on / blocked by:** TODO 4 (BYOD privacy mode design-partner cycle) OR a v1.3 user explicitly asking for it. Target: v1.4 if a design partner asks, else v2.

## TODO 11 — macOS watcher tests flake on CI (`internal/policy`)

**What:** `TestWatcher_DebouncesBursts` and `TestWatcher_ParallelFiresStayBounded` in `internal/policy/watcher_test.go` intermittently fail on macOS CI runners (most recently on PR #13's `test-macos` job; passed clean locally). Failure is `watcher never fired` — the kqueue-backed fsnotify watcher misses callbacks under macOS's burstier event coalescing.

**Why:** Flaky CI erodes trust in the test suite. A real macOS-only regression would currently hide in the noise. The fix is the v1.2 fsnotify policy-watcher work (commit `5bfd998 fix(policy): watch policy.yaml file directly on macOS (kqueue)`) — same family of issues, same root cause.

**Pros:**
- Restores the macOS CI signal to "fail means regression."
- Same fsnotify code path that the daemon depends on in production for `~/.audr/policy.yaml` hot-reload. If it flakes in tests, the hot-reload may also miss edits under bursty conditions.

**Cons:**
- kqueue/FSEvents timing is system-load-dependent; "fix the flake" can become "make the assertion looser," which masks real bugs.
- Possible upstream `fsnotify/fsnotify` issue rather than ours.

**Context:** Surfaced 2026-05-16 during /land-and-deploy of v0.10.1 (PR #13). v0.10.0 CI was clean — flake is intermittent, not deterministic. Likely fixes: longer debounce window in tests, retry-on-timeout, or watch via polling fallback under macOS CI runners.

**Depends on / blocked by:** Nothing. Pure maintenance. Target: v0.11.x or whenever the policy watcher gets touched next.

## TODO 12 — Dashboard "Copy AI prompt" → `internal/output.Prompt()`

**What:** Migrate the daemon dashboard's "Copy AI prompt" affordance (currently driven by the templates package at `internal/templates/`) to call the shared `internal/output.Prompt()` renderer. The CLI's `audr findings show --format prompt` and the dashboard button should emit byte-equal output.

**Why:** v0.13 introduced `internal/output/prompt.go` as the single source of truth for AI-prompt rendering — UNTRUSTED-CONTEXT envelope, ANSI / zero-width / Tag-block stripping, alt-delimiter fallback, triple-backtick escape. The dashboard currently runs a different code path (template-driven prose, no envelope). Without migration, the two surfaces drift: a user copying the prompt from the dashboard gets a different injection-defense posture than an agent reading the CLI output.

**Pros:**
- One renderer, two surfaces — matches DESIGN.md's surface-drift rule
- Tightens the security posture on the dashboard (envelope + sanitization apply to "Copy AI prompt" too)
- Reduces template surface area in `internal/templates/`

**Cons:**
- Requires a `state.Finding → finding.Finding` inverse converter for each kind (file, dep-package, os-package). The existing daemon path is one-way; reversing it preserves locator metadata but not the original Match string for dep findings (they encode "ecosystem name@version" in Match; the daemon stores parsed fields, not the original).
- Existing template-driven prompts have rule-specific prose (OSV templates name the manifest format, etc.) — the envelope renderer would need to keep that prose accessible via `Finding.SuggestedFix` or a similar field.

**Context:** Surfaced 2026-05-16 during the v0.13 plan-eng-review. Marked CHANGED rather than DONE in the plan completion audit because the work is real but the inverse-converter design needs its own pass. Target: v0.14.

**Depends on / blocked by:** Nothing. Independent of any v0.13 follow-on work.

---

## TODO 13 — HMAC-signed `--baseline` files

**What:** Stamp every `audr scan -f json` output with an HMAC over (generated_at, version, sorted finding ids) using a key in `~/.audr/baseline.key` (auto-created on first scan, mode 0600). On `audr scan --baseline=<path>` load, verify the HMAC and refuse with a clear error if missing or mismatched.

**Why:** v0.13 ships the "agent cannot fake `resolved` via `.audrignore`" invariant — the diff truth runs with suppressions OFF. But the baseline file itself is unsigned plaintext JSON. An agent with write access to the baseline file can fabricate fake finding ids that the diff will mark resolved without the underlying code being fixed. Signing closes the gap.

**Pros:**
- Closes the last threat-model gap in the AI fix loop
- Cheap implementation: one HMAC, one key file, ~50 LOC
- Per-machine key (no user setup) keeps the UX zero-friction
- Surfaced as a known limitation in v0.13's CHANGELOG; signing makes the security story complete

**Cons:**
- Adds a new state file (`~/.audr/baseline.key`) — small but persistent
- Cross-machine workflows (CI baselines shipped between machines) break unless the key is also shipped, which defeats the protection. Could be opt-out via `--unsigned-baseline` flag for those workflows.
- The threat model is bounded: a malicious agent with write access to before.json typically also has write access to the source it's "fixing", so the agent has bigger attack vectors than spoofing baseline diffs.

**Context:** Surfaced 2026-05-16 during the v0.13 adversarial review (Finding 3). Documented as a known limitation in v0.13's CHANGELOG. Target: v0.14 alongside TODO 12.

**Depends on / blocked by:** Nothing. Independent.
